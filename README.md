# Neural-Networks-Image-Classification
Building and training a neural network to classify images from a standard dataset.

This repository contains a set of Python scripts for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project demonstrates a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization of predictions.
